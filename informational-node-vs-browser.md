As we noted in the [introduction](https://github.com/bkager/Node-cookbook/blob/main/introduction.md), JavaScript has multiple software environments in which it can run. Web browsers are the original runtime environment of JavaScript code, and provide web-related functionality. Node is another runtime environment


-any code needs a runtime environment
-There's the core programming language
-There's stuff the runtime environment provides. These are _program features_, not part of the core language
-Stuff that is part of the JS language
-Stuff browsers and Node both provide
 -JS engine
 - event loop
-Stuff only browsers provide (briefly)
 - Web APIs
-Stuff only Node provides
 - Core Node modules
