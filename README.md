# The Tiny Node Cookbook
## Tasty, bite-sized recipes for learning Node.js

I love Node, but it can be hard to get started. The documentation in particular is not the most intuitive for new users, especially if JavaScript is your first programming language. I've found that a lot of existing tutorials echo this confusion--good at teaching bits and pieces, but not great at giving a top-down view of how everything fits together or prepping you to strike out on your own. 

This collection of Node recipes--tiny programs meant to demonstrate one or two features each--is intended to demonstrate the basic features of Node in a friendly, incremental way.

### Goals

* Demonstrate basic features of Node by building tiny programs
* Introduce new users to Node's docs
* Give new users enough basic knowledge to learn and build more on their own

### Who is this for?

This is aimed very much at beginners. If you're new to Node but have experience in other programming languages, you may find some of this, especially the early recipes, pretty basic. If JavaScript is your first programming language and you're just starting to lean Node, you should hopefully find that little background knowledge is assumed. I've tried to err on the side of overexplaining rather than underexplaining because there are already plenty of Node tutorials that do the opposite.

I am assuming that readers understand JavaScript fundamentals, including the structure of the language and how classes/inheritence work, basic HTML/CSS, are comfortable using a development environment like VSCode, and have some very basic familiarity with using a terminal and the command line.

In many ways, this for myself. I'd like to feel like I have a more comprehensive grasp of Node, and having to explain a topic is a great way to find where you're missing pieces. Here's the stuff I wish had been explained more clearly when I started.

Questions, suggestions, and corrections are very welcome.
