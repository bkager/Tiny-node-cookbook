# The Node REPL

You'll usually save code permanently in files. However, Node also offers an environment in which you can rapidly try out JavaScript code without saving it. The Node REPL, or Node shell, is a command-line program where you can write and run JavaScript code line by line. REPL stands for "Read-eval-print-loop", and that's the basic loop of actions that will happen in it--you'll write code and then Node will read it, evalute your variables and functions, and print out the results. If you have enough practice with JavaScript to be reading this cookbook, you've probably used JavaScript in some sort of REPL before, whether in an online learn-to-code environment, your browser dev tools, or somewhere else. The Node REPL is a great way to test small things out quickly. 

You can access the Node REPL by opening a terminal and typing `node`. You'll try this out in the next recipe.
