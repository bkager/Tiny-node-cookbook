## Welcome to Node!
## What Node is and does
## How this cookbook is organized

This book has two main sections: 
1) Node Basics: A Minimal Introduction to Some Important Bits
2) Beyond the Basics

The first section, Node Basics, introduces fundamental Node concepts and the Node docs, and then covers a number of the topics you're most likely to need to know at a level of detail that will get you started. This includes using the Node REPL, writing and publishing simple scripts, simple filesystem operations, and creating a server in vanilla Node. 

The second section, Beyond the Basics, returns to many of these topics in more detail. 

## Keeping your own cookbook / notes
## Installing Node
